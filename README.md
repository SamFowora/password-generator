## Description

This is a password generator, giving the randomised option of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters.
The project was my biggest challenge yet, but with some help I have finally gained some understanding of javascript functions and how to implement different parts in different places.
Though a few bugs (who have really earned their name considering how minor, but annoying they have been) popped up, they were solved with a bit of effort. That part gave me a massive insight into how tedious the debugging process can be.

Rene Trevino for the massive help he gave, especially with the debugging. It would not have been something I would have noticed so I thank God he was there.
